## A normal Blog

This is a full functional blog built using the Laravel technology, here you can post content, titles, cover pictures and some other. The Laravel version this blog uses is the 5.7 version.

This project is just a normal blog, it doesn't have anything special, I did it because I wanted to learn the basics of Laravel and this project coverd all of them

For this project I followd the Traversy media's youtube series, you'll find out this project and his tutorial's are pretty much the same

## What I Learned
In this project I leaned...

 - To use Laravel's routing
 - To interact with the database 
 - MVC Structure
 - Some Blade systax
