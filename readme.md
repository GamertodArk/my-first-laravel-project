## A normal Blog

This project is just a normal blog, it doesn't have anything special, I did it because I wanted to learn the basics of Laravel and this project coverd all of them

For this project I followd the Traversy media's youtube series, you'll find out this project and his tutorial's are pretty much the same

## What I Learned
In this project I leaned...

 - To use Laravel's routing
 - To interact with the database 
 - MVC Structure
 - Some Blade systax
